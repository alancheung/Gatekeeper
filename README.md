# Gatekeeper
Gatekeeper is a project I started to replace the cheaply made keypad controlling the magnetic lock on my office door. Gatekeeper is designed to run on a RaspberryPi and was originally written in Python. Development on the Python version reached an acceptable point and ultimately Gatekeeper was re-engineered in C# (using Mono).
